# npcausal

This package provides a variety of tools for nonparametric estimation of causal effects across a wide range of settings. The methods are based on the theory of influence functions, and can incorporate flexible machine learning and high-dimensional regression tools, while still yielding inference in the form of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Many of the methods are doubly robust.

## Installing

To install and load this package in R from GitHub, run the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools) 
install_github("ehkennedy/npcausal")
library(npcausal)
```
Along with standard treatment effect estimators, npcausal can also implement methods from my papers, including:
